\begin{ingreds}
    3 eggs
    300g plain flour
    150ml milk
    butter for frying
\end{ingreds}

\begin{method}
    Whisk together the eggs and flour.

    Add the milk to make a batter that will thinly coat the
    back of a spoon.  Be careful not to over whisk or the batter
    won't be light.

    Heat a pan, and when it is very hot, add a knob of butter.

    Using a ladle pour in enough batter to thinly coat the base of
    the pan.

    Cook until golden, then flip the pancake over and cook on the
    other side.

\end{method}
