\recipe[A parciluar favourite in Greece, where the distinct flavour of Rigani is particularly appreciated.  A favourite for BBQs]{Rigani Lamb or Chicken}
\preptime{15 minutes}
\cooktime{7-10 minutes}

\begin{ingreds}
	150ml olive oil
	juice of 1 lemon
	2 onions, peeled
	2 bay leaves cut into small pieces
	2 teaspoons of dried rigani
	pulp of 2 tomatoes
	salt and pepper
\end{ingreds}

\begin{method}[I often use a tin of peeled timatoes instead of pulp.  Marinading overnight is highly recommended.]
     	Add all the ingredients to a blender and mix in a couple of bursts.

	Cube the meat and marinate for at least 3 hours, ideally overnight in the fridge.

	Drain the cubes and thread them on to skewers.

	Grill whilst basting regularly until the cubes are of a rich brown colour outside, but still pink and juicy within.
