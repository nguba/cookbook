\recipe[Classic French bread as I often like to make]{Baguette}
\label{rec:bread-baguette}
\preptime{5 hours}
\cooktime{25 minutes}

\begin{ingreds}
	400 g sourdough starter
	1000g french T85 flour
	20g sea salt
	620g water
\end{ingreds}

\begin{method}[Ensure the water is free of chlorine or other antisteptic additives.]
Dissolve the sourdough starter in the water and add the flour and mix coarsely.

Add the dry yeast and salt.

Now knead the flour using the stretch and fold technique, gently making 4 folds  every 15 minutes for a total time of about 2 1/2 hours.

Prepare oven for hearth baking by adding a pan filled with lava rocks at the bottom and preheat the to the maximum temperature, usually \temp{250} or higher.

Let the dough rise for 1 - 1 1/2 hours, then divide into equal rectangles.

Rest for about 30 minutes, then shape the dough into baguette rolls and transfer each baguette to their 'couche'.

Leave to rise for 1 1/2 - 2 hours.

Pour a glass of water over the lava rocks, make the incisions into the dough and transfer into the oven.

Bake until deep golden,  usually 20--25 minutes at 240$^{\circ}$ Celsius

Transfer to cooling rack.

\recipe[This makes 6 amazing tasting croissants]{Croissants}
\label{rec:bread-croissant}
\preptime{5 hours}
\cooktime{25 minutes}

\begin{ingreds}
    200g T45 Flour
    200g T65 Flour
    60g Sugar
    100g Milk
    100g Water
    20g Beaten Egg
    8g Salt
    16g Fresh Yeast or 8g Dry Yeast
    250g Beurre de Tourage (min 82\% fat)
\end{ingreds}

\begin{method}
    Mix Sugar, egg, milk and water until all sugar is dissolved.

    Add flour, yeast and salt and knead until surface is soft.

    Form into a paton (similar to baguette) and rest for 30 minutes at room temperature.

    Shape dough into a 20x25cm .

    Shape butter into 20x13cm rectangle.

    Proof both at least 2 hours at \temp{4} in the fridge, or overnight.

    Take both from fridge, roll out and make a double turn.

    Return détrempe to fridge for at least 30 minutes.

    Take from fridge, roll out and make a single turn.

    Return détrempe to fridge for at least 30 minutes.

    Roll out into 25cm x 25cm sheet and shape croissants.

    Proof croissants at least 2.5 hours around \temp{27}.
    You can tell your croissants are done proofing when they are puffy and jiggly,
    and a gentle touch leaves a slight indentation that slowly springs back.
    If the indentation springs back immediately, they need more time; if it stays, they are overproofed.


    Apply egg wash to croissants after they are fully proofed, just before baking.
    For a better golden color, some bakers recommend applying a second layer of egg wash five minutes before baking.
    Avoid brushing the egg wash on the sides of the croissant where the layers are exposed, as this can seal them
    together and prevent them from puffing up correctly.

    Bake for 15 minutes at \temp{160}.
