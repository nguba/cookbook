\recipe[Pasta dough with a lot of 'bite' due to the increased content in Semolina.]{Egg Pasta}
\label{rec:egg-pasta}
\preptime{1 1/2 hour}
\serves{4}

\begin{ingreds}
	100g Semolina
	300g Italian '00' flour
	4 large eggs 

\end{ingreds}

\begin{method}[Eggs should not come directly from the fridge.  They should be at room temperature for best results.]		
     	Add the semolina and flour into a bowl.

	Break all the eggs over the bowl and mix with the round side of the spoon to ensure all flour is hydrated.  This is a rather dry dough, don't panic when it looks like there won't be enough water to hydrate all the flour.

	Continue mixing by hand, ensuring no flour is left over and shape the dough into a ball.

	Cover with wet towel and rest for 30-45 minutes to autolyse the dough.

	Knead the dough into a smooth paste.

	Cover with cling film and rest for one hour, alternatively leave in the fridge overnight.
